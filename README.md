#### Bash-Script Repo
--------------------
The Bash-Script repository serves as a "collection bin" for all bash scripts (and commands) that I have come across, and most likely have used.

As of writing this README, most of the scripts are simple scripts (most of them one-liner). Accompanying these (one-liners) are comments to clarify the command itself.
